# LS3
Latent Semantic Analysis-based Similarity Search for Process Models

### Description
The LS3 Java API can be used to query process models stored as PNML files. It is developed as part of a PhD thesis at the [Institute AIFB](http://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/Hauptseite/en) of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) (KIT). As it is a research prototype, please reference it in your publications as described below.

### Code and Used Libraries
The code is stored as a maven project with pom.xml included for the external library dependencies. The following external libraries are used in the LS3 API:

* [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)
* [JDOM2](http://www.jdom.org/)
* [Google Collections](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.collections/google-collections/1.0)
* [Apache Commons Math3](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)
* [Apache Commons IO](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/)
* [Porter Stemmer](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/gov.sandia.foundry/porter-stemmer)
